			<h1>Lab 3 - File Structure</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>We are creating a reliable file structure for the entirety of the class.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I had no idea how to do unordered lists on html because I forgot. Quick
						little google search and I was good. CSS is still hard and I was confused why # didn't work
					but I was able to find a solution.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>As I'm doing the lab it feels pretty chill getting used to formatting
						html and seeing how css could be used around the html. I still have
					lots of trouble with css especially because I literally have to look up the parameters. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<!--I had help from my partner for this part of the code. I wasn't able to properly link the images, but I also used the ordered list!--> 
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>currently looking at the html site resulted from the lab
