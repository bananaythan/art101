			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding and Problem-solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>To pseudocode a simple computer game and everyday task</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I wasn't really sure how I wanted to format the page
						as well as how I was going to put all the items in a list
						but I remembered last lab we used lists so that helped a lot!
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>The lab was pretty simple but still took a while as I am still
						getting used to setting up CSS formatting for HTML. It is definitely
						a good continuation off of lab 3. 	
					</p>

					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>Pseudocoding an Everyday Task
						<ol>
							<li>Find another car</li>
							<li>Connect Jumper Cables</li>
						<ol>
							<li>Attach red to red of your battery, then red to red of the other car</li>
							<li>Attach black to black of the other car, then black to metal part of dead battery
							</li>
						</ol>
							<li>Start the other Cars Engine</li>
							<li>Start the Dead Car</li>
						<ol>
							<li>Accelerate a bit on other car if jumpstart does not work after few tries</li>
