				<h1>Hello World!</h1>
					<p>Hello! We are Soriah & Nathan, we are in separate sections, but completed this lab together online. Soriah is a 3rd-year Sociology
					and education major, that is interested in painting and animation but would like to learn more about how to create digital art. Nathan is a 4th-year AGPM major looking to develop games. He would like to design a gameplay system and the levels in a popular game. We look forward to what I will learn from this course!
